Homunculus is a tabletop role-playing game inspired by the Goblin Laws of Gaming, Cairn, and Stars/Worlds/Cities Without Number, written by Maxwell Madden.

This system is a Frankenstein of good ideas thought up by a great variety of OSR creators, with a few original idea/tweaks of my own. To honor the creators of the many components of this game, I have indicated the source of any and all mechanics and concepts used within Homunculus in the Attributions section of this document.
