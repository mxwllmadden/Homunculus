### Formatting Key

**Bolded** terms are key game terms that refer to specific mechanics.

*Italicized* terms are known as 'tags' and are often applied to items or monsters as a shorthand for to describe their qualities.

Dice are notated as NdS where you should roll N number of S sided dice and take the sum of the resulting dice. If you are NOT meant to take the sum of the dice, but instead use their individual values, it will instead be noted as NxdS or dS + dS.

## Character Creation

### Reaction Scores

Player characters have four **Reactions** which represent different components of your characterâ€™s abilities and outward appearance. The reactions are **Swords**, **Silks**, **Masks**, **Crowns**, and **Wands**. For each one, roll **3d6** and consult the table below.

### Resolve

Resolve represents you ability to avoid taking damage in combat. It has a maximum score and current score. Resolve can be recovered relatively easily (see Bolstering Resolve). Roll 1d6 to determine your current **Maximum Resolve**.

### Inventories

There are 4 seperate inventories in Homunculus: 
 - **Item Slots**, which contain your worn and carried items. You have 4 which contain equipped items and 6 which correspond to space within your backpack for a total of 10 slots.
 - **Spirit Slots**, which contain skills, hirelings, and spells. You have **two** at first level and will gain an additional **two** each level up to level-4.
 - **Charm Slots**, which contain worn magic rings, amulets, charmsigns, and talismans. You have **two** charm slots.
 - **Wound Slots**, which contain **wounds**. If you ever take a wound and don't have a slot to put it in, you die instantly without a save. You always have **three** wound slots. They are marked with numbers ( 6 , 8 , 10 ) which correspond to the difficulty of the save required to resist the effects of the **wound**.
